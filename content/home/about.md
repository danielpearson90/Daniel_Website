# Biography

I am a researcher in cognitive psychology based at the University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney). I am currently working with [A/Prof. Mike Le Pelley](http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/contacts-people/academic-staff/associate-professor-mike-le-pelley) and [A/Prof. Thomas Whitford](http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/contacts-people/academic-staff/associate-professor-thomas-whitford) on a research project examining the effect of reward learning on attentional capture and control processes. You can find the details of my publications and presentations on this topic (and some others) below, or by downloading my {{% staticref "files/Daniel Pearson CV.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}.

I am also a Provisional Psychologist, and have recently completed a Master of Psychology (Clinical). As part of this training, I have gained experience working clinically with individuals experiencing depression, anxiety disorders, trauma, and psychosis.
