# Biography

I am a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist at UCL. I am currently working with [Prof. Nilli Lavie](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/people/nilli-lavie) as a post-doctoral research fellow on projects examining the influence of perceptual capacity, cognitive control, and learned experience (i.e., selection history) on attention. 

I am interested in understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying selective attention, with a view to applying these findings to real world contexts (e.g., designing alerts and warnings to rapidly capture attention) as well as to further our understanding of psychopathology (e.g., understanding how attention to reward-related cues interacts with substance use disorder and psychosis).

You can find the details of my recent publications and presentations below. A full list of research outputs is available in my {{% staticref "files/Daniel Pearson CV.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}.

<!--I am also trained as a clinical psychologist, however I am not currently practicing. As part of this training, I have gained experience working clinically with individuals experiencing depression, anxiety disorders, trauma, and psychosis. -->
